# PID-Control-System

 A PID (proportional–integral–derivative) control system is a control loop mechanism employing 
feedback and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. A PID 
controller continuously calculates an error value e(t) as the difference between the desired setpoint 
(SP) and a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, 
and derivative terms.
